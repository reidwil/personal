# Mechanation

Sole Creators: Hank Womble and Trey White

--------------------

You and three other Pilots are at war, and you are all sending your army of Mechs to unexplored (or currently occupied) territories to fight to the death and claim new land for yourselves. The game is simple: If you’ve got the better Mech, you win the battle. However, no war was ever won in a day, and it will take a bit of scheming and clever thinking to come out on top of this war. Which territories do you need? Which ones are your opponents eyeing? Which Mechs have your rivals been building in preparation for this war? In Mechanation, you are put in the Pilot’s seat as you strategize, collude, and bluff your way to victory. In a war fought between machines, it’s every Pilot for themselves.

## Objective

> Your mission: Claim a set of 5 Territories before the other Pilots. The set must contain either 5 of any one color, or 5 of any one number. So for example, you win the game if you collect 5 Green Territories, or if you collect 5 Territories that all have the number 3 on them. Be on the lookout for WILD Territories as well, as these can count as any Territory toward your count!

## Setup

- First, divide the Mechs into 3 stacks according to whether or not they are Tier 1, 2, or 3, and then shuffle those stacks and place them face down on the table.
- Next, shuffle all of the Territories, and place that pile face down on the table as well. Go around the table, and have every pilot take 3 territories randomly from the top of the deck.
- Next, go around the table again, and have every Pilot take one Mech randomly from the top of each of the 3 Mech Decks.
- Once every pilot has 3 Mechs and 3 Territories, remove the unclaimed Mechs from the table, as they will not be used for this game.
    - **Be careful not to accidentally look at the unused Mechs!**
- After all Pilots have had a chance to view their cards, each Pilot should place their Territories face down in front of them, and hold on to their Mechs in order to form their hands.
- Once all Pilots are ready, determine a Pilot to be the Alpha Pilot, and you’re ready for battle!

## Game Phases

Mechanation is broken down into 4 Phases that happen on every turn.

1. Initiation Phase
2. Arena Phase
3. Pilot Phase
4. Scrap Phase

### Initiation Phase
Starting with the player who is currently the Alpha Pilot (link?) and continuing clockwise, each Pilot must execute the following commands:
- If you have any face-down Territories, you must reveal one of them. (If you have no face-down Territories, then you do not have to reveal any cards.)
- Repair any Mech that is currently in your hangar by 1 Stage. **Note:** No one will have any Mechs in their hangar on the first turn of the game, so this step will be unnecessary at the very beginning of the game.

Also, if a Pilot has a Mech that has an ability that activates during their Initiation Phase, then this would be the time in which they would activate that effect. 

	After each Pilot has taken their Initiative Phase, then play continues to the Second Phase of each turn, which is the Arena Phase. At the start of each Arena Phase, the Alpha Pilot deals two Territories from the top of the Territory deck to the middle of the table: one face-up, and one face-down. Now, starting with the Alpha Pilot and continuing clockwise, each Pilot may execute the following:
	
A Pilot may Deploy one of their Mechs to one of the newly discovered Territories by placing one of the Mechs in their hand face-down beside the territory they would like to claim. A pilot can not deploy a Mech to a territory that already has 2 other Mechs deployed to it! A Territory that has a Mech deployed to it is considered Occupied.
If a Pilot feels like the battle could be over before it begins, or if their Hangar is filled with defeated Mechs, that Pilot may choose to pass on their turn in the Arena Phase by not deploying a Mechs to any of the newly discovered Territories. 
If a Pilot has a Mech whose ability activates during their turn in the Arena Phase, that Pilot may activate that ability during this Phase. 

Once every Pilot has taken their turn deploying Mechs to the Arena, the battles are resolved starting with the Territory that is face-up. Both Pilots reveal their Mechs simultaneously, and then resolve the battle. Battles are discussed a little bit later, so if you need some help resolving a battle, turn to the “Battling” section. If you are the winner, then congratulations, you have claimed that Territory! Add that Territory to the others on the table in front of you. If the Territory that you claimed was face-down, you may look at the Territory, but it remains face-down when you add it to your collection in front of you. Any Mech that was defeated in Battle is considered Disabled, and it should be placed-face-up in the respective Pilot’s Hangar. If your Mech was the only Mech that was deployed to that Territory, then you claim that Territory uncontested. Add that Territory to your collection, but do not reveal the Mech that you deployed! That’s information that you may want to keep secret until a future battle! If a Territory in the Arena was unclaimed due to a tie or perhaps due to no Mechs being deployed to it, then that Territory remains in the Arena, and will be up for grabs in the Arena Phase of the next turn. 

	After all battles in the Arena have been resolved, then play continues to the third phase, the Pilot Phase. During the Pilot Phase, the Pilot who is the Alpha Pilot may execute the following:

The Alpha Pilot may deploy one Mech to any face-up Territory that an opposing Pilot controls by placing a Mech face-down next to the territory they wish to claim. The defending pilot may choose to defend with a Mech of their choice, and if they do, both players reveal their Mechs simultaneously, and resolve the Battle. If the Alpha PIlot wins, then they claim the Territory! If the defending Pilot successfully defends against the attack, then that Pilot retains his Territory, but does not claim any new one. The Mech that is defeated in Battle is Disabled, and is placed face-up in their Pilot’s Hangar. If the defending Pilot does not like his chances in the Battle, then he is not obligated to use any Mechs to defend it. In this circumstance, the Alpha Pilot claims the Territory uncontested, and does not reveal which Mech he deployed to the Battle. 
If the Alpha Pilot does not feel like they can claim a Territory from any of the other PIlots, they do not have to Deploy any Mechs during this phase.
If the Alpha Pilot has any Mechs which have abilities that activate during their Pilot Phase, then they may activate those abilities at this time. 

The Alpha Pilot may only Deploy 1 Mech per Pilot Phase, so after the Battle has been resolved, or once the Alpha Pilot has decided to pass,then play will continue to the next phase.

	The final phase of each turn is the Scrap Phase. During this phase, any pilot who has more than 6 controlled Territories must scrap Territories until they only have 6. Scrapped territories go in a pile face-up next to the Territory deck. When the Territory Deck runs out, the Scrap Pile should be shuffled and placed face-down to become the new territory deck. Also, if any Pilots have a Mech which has an ability that activates during the Scrap Phase, then they may activate that ability at this time. Once all Pilots have executed their Scrap Phase, then the Pilot who currently possesses the Alpha Pilot token passes the token clockwise, and that Pilot is now the Alpha Pilot. 

And that’s the turn breakdown! From here, play returns to the Initiative Phase, and play will continue in this cycle until a Pilot has completed the Objective. 


Battling:

	Sometimes, to claim a Territory, you’ve got to square off head-to-head with another Mech in battle. And sometimes, a battle can consist more of just raw power. Here’s how to go about resolving a Battle:

When Battling, both Pilots reveal their deployed Mechs simultaneously. 
Compare the Power Levels of both Mechs involved. The Mech with the highest Power Level wins!
Sometimes, Power Levels aren’t all that goes into a battle. If the Mech has an ability that activates during a Battle, then a Pilot can activate that ability now. 
After all “During Battle” abilities have been activated, the Pilot whose Mech won the battle, claims the Territory that was being fought over. The Mech that was defeated in Battle becomes Disabled, and is placed face-up in that Pilot’s Hangar.
After the Territory has been claimed, the Battle is resolved, and any ability that a Mech has that activates after a Battle has been resolved can be activated now. 

And that’s all there is to Battling! Some Mechs have some specific abilities that may activate after a Territory has been claimed, or if they lose a Battle, so make sure to activate those effects at the correct time! If there is discrepancy about when a Mech’s ability will activate in relation to a Battle, then refer to that Mech’s detailed description for more information. Also, remember that by default, a Mech that is defeated in Battle is Disabled and placed face-up in the respective Pilot’s Hangar. However, there may be certain effects that cause a Mech to not be disabled as a result of a battle, or even worse, cause that Mech to Malfunction. Remember, if there is a Mech interaction that you are unsure of, consult that Mechs entry in this rulebook to get a better insight into how that Mech’s ability works. 


The Hangar

	The Hangar is the area of the table in front of each pilot that is reserved for Mechs that are currently in repair. When a Mech is defeated in Battle, it is Disabled, and placed face-up in the Hangar. There are 3 Stages of Repair, from Best to Worst:

Stand-By (STB) (Signified by an Upright Card)
Disabled (DIS) (Signified by a Sideways Card)
Malfunctioned (MALF) (Signified by an Upside-Down Card)

Whenever you Repair your Mechs in the Initiative Phase, a Mech is progressed in Repair by one stage. So, if a Mech is Malfunctioned, it becomes Disabled. If a Mech is Disabled, it goes on Stand-By. And if a Mech is in Stand-By when you repair it, it returns to your Hand. By this merit, a Mech that is defeated in Battle takes 2 Repair Phases to return to your Hand, ready to participate in another Battle. A Mech that is Malfunctioned due to an effect takes 3 Repair Phases to return to your Hand, so be wise when handling Mechs that could possibly Malfunction!
