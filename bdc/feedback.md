# Feedback Response

Hi Reid,

Thank you for your patience as I distill feedback from the team on your submission. Here is what I've gathered:

For Part 1:
- The CTEs written didn't produce the expected results. On our end, we felt like there was more logic than necessary for the amount of CTEs, which is what likely resulted in the incorrect calculations. We would have found it helpful to see these broken into smaller pieces.

For Part 2:
- Your attention to detail in the Python function was impressive.
- However, the function did not work. We noticed the missing step of creating a table in Snowflake; it didn't account for files with columns in the wrong order.
- Otherwise, your documentation for the client and team members was strong and what we would like to see among our team!
